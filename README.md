# About

Sonic Adventure DX Randomizer is a mod for the PC version of SADX. This mod loads random characters into random stages in a random order with some custom layouts to make them beatable.
Big in Speed Highway? Amy vs Egg Viper? Sonic in Hot Shelter? Yeah, this is happening!

What does it randomizes:
Character, Stage, Race AI, Partner AI, Music, Voices. It also adds extra content like Sonic Adventure 2 missions. (100 Rings, Lost Chao...)

Note: You can change the settings according to your play style. (SA2 missions, disable a character...) You can also swap Character and AI by pressing the Y / Triangle button, just like in Sonic Heroes.


# Installation:

Set up the mod:

1) Make sure you have the latest version of SADX Mod Loader downloaded and installed from this [link.](https://sadxmodinstaller.unreliable.network/)
2) Download the latest version of SADX Randomizer and place the entire folder in the mods folder.
3) If all the above steps have been done properly, you should be able to run SADX Mod Manager and select the mod in the list.
4) To configure options for SADX Rando, select the mod in the Mod Manager and click on 'Configure...' to see all the options.
5) If you want to race with a friend, make sure both of you are using the same "seed" in the settings, also make sure the seed used is different than "0". (0 makes the rng always different, while using another number makes it consistent.)
6) Click on Save and play!

# How to use:

Once you are done with the settings, start the game, create a new savefile, then enjoy the show!
A story ends once you beat a specific number of stages depending on the character selected.

# The End

So here it is, after three years, SADX Rando got its final major update. The mod will continue to be updated for bug fixes from time to time, but that's all, don't expect new content.

All I can say is thank you, this was my very first mod and I can't believe how far it comes. I made mistakes, I learned, I improved and made this mod more and more crazy thanks to all the amazing people on x-hax and some programmers friends.

I watched many videos on Twitch and YouTube of people playing it, it was really amazing to see people reactions discovering this mod. I put my whole soul on this and I'm really happy with this project, but now it's time to move on.

I'm still working on other projects for SADX and also SA2, for more information, you can follow me on Twitter.

Once again, thank you for playing this mod and I hope you enjoyed this crazy journey as much as I did!

Peace!

Sora.
